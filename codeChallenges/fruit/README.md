A solution to this code challenge. Usage:

  `$ node fruit.js`

Little Jenny has been sent to the market with a 5 dollar bill in hand, to buy fruits for a gift basket for the new neighbors. Since she's a diligent and literal-minded kid, she intends to spend exactly 5 dollars - not one cent more or less.
The fact that the market sells fruits per piece at non-round prices, does not make this easy - but Jenny is prepared. She takes out a Netbook from her backpack, types in the unit prices of some of the fruits she sees, and fires off a program from her collection - and voil√†!, the possible fruit combinations for a $5 purchase appear on the screen.

<b>Challenge</b>: Show what Jenny's program might look like in the programming language of your choice.
* The goal is aways 500 cents (= $5).
* Solutions can include multiple fruits of the same type - assume they're available in unlimited quantities.
* Solutions do not need to include all available types of fruit.
* Determine all possible solutions for the given input.
